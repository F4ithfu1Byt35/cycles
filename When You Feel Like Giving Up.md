# Faithful Bytes: When You Feel Like Giving Up
*Real Life. Real Struggles. Real Truth.*

## Daily Byte:
“I keep speaking up. I keep trying. But it feels like no one hears me, no one helps. I'm ready to give up.”

### Biblical Truth:
Even when no one else sees your effort, God does. When your voice feels unheard, He hears.

**“And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.” <sub>Galatians 6:9 (NKJV)</sub>**

**“The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry.” <sub>Psalm 34:15 (NKJV)</sub>**

**“Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the Lord your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.” <sub> Deuteronomy 31:6 (NKJV)</sub>**

### Quick Word:
Your effort is not wasted. Faithfulness isn’t always loud—it’s often quiet persistence. God sees. God hears. Stay the course.
